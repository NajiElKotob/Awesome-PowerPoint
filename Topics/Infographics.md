* Minard
    * A particular example of the easy storytelling genre are maps, and a particularly famous example is Charles Minard’s visualization of Napoleon’s Russian campaign in 1812/13. While not immediately obvious if you haven’t seen it before, this is really a map, with the Polish border in the west and Moscow in the east. The width of the ribbon shows the number of men in Napoleon’s army: he starts out with 422,000, loses a lot of them before he even reaches Moscow, where he arrives with 100,000; turns around and makes it back with all of 10,000 men.

* [What is a pictogram?](https://venngage.com/blog/pictogram/) A pictogram is one of the simplest (and most popular) forms of data visualization out there. Also known as “pictographs”, “icon charts”, “picture charts”, and “pictorial unit charts”, pictograms use a series of repeated icons to visualize simple data. The icons are arranged in a single line or a grid, with each icon representing a certain number of units (usually 1, 10, or 100).
