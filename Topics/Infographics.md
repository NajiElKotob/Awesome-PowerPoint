## Best Infographics
* [The Great War](https://www.behance.net/gallery/33773376/Great-War-Infographic)
* Minard
    * A particular example of the easy storytelling genre are maps, and a particularly famous example is Charles Minard‚Äôs visualization of Napoleon‚Äôs Russian campaign in 1812/13. While not immediately obvious if you haven‚Äôt seen it before, this is really a map, with the Polish border in the west and Moscow in the east. The width of the ribbon shows the number of men in Napoleon‚Äôs army: he starts out with 422,000, loses a lot of them before he even reaches Moscow, where he arrives with 100,000; turns around and makes it back with all of 10,000 men.

    * [Touching Minard](https://medium.com/nightingale/touching-minard-6398274e07ef) 
    * [The Greatest Ever Infographic - Numberphile üì∫](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T7jMcstxY0) - Infographics are not new. In 1862 Charles Joseph Minard created a much-praised infographic depicting Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812.

## Articles
* [What is a pictogram?](https://venngage.com/blog/pictogram/) A pictogram is one of the simplest (and most popular) forms of data visualization out there. Also known as ‚Äúpictographs‚Äù, ‚Äúicon charts‚Äù, ‚Äúpicture charts‚Äù, and ‚Äúpictorial unit charts‚Äù, pictograms use a series of repeated icons to visualize simple data. The icons are arranged in a single line or a grid, with each icon representing a certain number of units (usually 1, 10, or 100).

## Papers
* [Statistical data presentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5453888/) - A table is best suited for representing individual information and represents both quantitative and qualitative information. A graph is a very effective visual tool as it displays data at a glance, facilitates comparison, and can reveal trends and relationships within the data such as changes over time, frequency distribution, and correlation or relative share of a whole. Text, tables, and graphs for data and information presentation are very powerful communication tools. They can make an article easy to understand, attract and sustain the interest of readers, and efficiently present large amounts of complex information.
