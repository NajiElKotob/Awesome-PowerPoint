# Best Practices

* Use Slide Master for Consistency: Edit your PowerPoint template using the Slide Master to ensure consistency in fonts, colors, and designs across all slides​​.
* Duplicate Slides to Save Time: Use the duplicate slide and copy-paste methods to quickly reuse slides from previous presentations​​.

* Style and Color: Settle on a specific style and color theme. Customize these to fit your presentation's needs, keeping in mind to use colors that are easy on the eyes and complementary​​. Avoid using too many colors, as it can be distracting​​.
* Use Basic Coloring and Contrast: Stick to basic coloring, especially for formal presentations. Use color to create contrast and emphasize key information​​. Remember to consider viewers with color blindness when choosing colors​​.
